I am learning to code with <strong>MIT xPRO</strong>, and this is a repository of my projects.<br> 
 I'm new to the coding world and am very excited to use my new skills. Formerly a college professor, I'm also a musician and educator, and I'm particularly interested in creative projects related to arts, music, and education.

Please check out my repos!
